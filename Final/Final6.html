      <p>Ever wondered how everyone gets that fake snow on their tree? Well, its called flocking! I'm going to give you a few tips and tricks on how to flock your tree.</p>
      <p>Begin by placing some newspaper or tarp under the tree as this will get messy. Adjust and fluff the tree until you achieve the desired shape. Get your flocking powder and place it in a strainer. Get a spray bottle of water and begin spraying the tree in sections. Once portions of the tree are damp, you can shake some of the flocking powder on that section. Continue to do this over the entire tree and that's it! It's best to work from top down and you can go back over it following the same steps as many times as you'd like!</p>
      <p>Hope you found this helpful!</p>
